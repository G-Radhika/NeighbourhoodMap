Thanks for checking out my Neighborhood map!!  To get started, simply open up index.html in your browser.  Further instructions are below:

-Click the map marker once and the marker will bounce and display the infowindow.  To stop the marker from bouncing, click the marker a second time or wait for for timeout to stop marker bouncing.  To close the infowindow, click the x in the top right corner of the infowindow.

-To view the streetview, click the 'Street View' link (opens in the same tab replacing the index.html page).  To return to the map, simply click the back button.

-Map locations are beaches, bridges, parks, coffee and pizzas! Pick one from select box--to return to the full listing click the browser page refresh button.

I hope you enjoyed exploring some of the interesting locations in San Francisco!
